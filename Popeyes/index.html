        <h1>Popeyes Of St.Charles</h1>
        <P>
            Does the idea of a Chicken Wing put a smile on your face? Does it remind you of happy times at a
            picnic, a ballpark, or on vacation? could an 10 Piece chicken meal with,
            New Orleans style red beans, Southern macaroni, chicken sandwiches and buttermilk biscuits resurrect those positive vibes?
            Then you understand the reason Popeyes was opened in 1972 in New Orleans and became a massive success with 2,700 locations, spanning accross the entire United States and other countries such as Isreal, Turkey, Austrailia, South Korea, and India.

            Popeyes is a place where amazing and affordable food, fun-loving staff, and bright colors
            provide you with a sanctuary of joy from the moment you cross its threshold. Combining louisianas cajun spice with local black culture, 
            Popeyes artfully crafted cuisine of Spicey Chicken ,
            cajun red beans, sandwiches and buttermilk biscuits are a thing of beauty.
